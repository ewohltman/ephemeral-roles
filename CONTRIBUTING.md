## Contributing
Contributions are very welcomed, however please follow the below guidelines.

- First open an issue describing the bug or enhancement so it can be
discussed
- Fork the develop branch and make your changes
- Try to match current naming conventions as closely as possible
- Try to keep changes small and incremental, with appropriate new unit tests
- Create a Pull Request with your changes against the develop branch
